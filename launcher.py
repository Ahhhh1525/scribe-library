"""
launcher.py — Native desktop launcher for Scribe Library.

Starts the Flask server on a free port in a background thread, then opens
a native macOS window via pywebview pointing at it. When the user closes
the window, the Python process shuts down (Flask thread is daemonized).

This is the entry point for a packaged macOS .app bundle, but it also works
as a normal Python script for development:

    python3 launcher.py

Design notes:
  - Flask runs in a thread, not a subprocess, so we get a single .app bundle
    instead of needing to ship two binaries
  - Werkzeug's auto-reloader is disabled (it forks the process which breaks
    pywebview's main-thread requirement on macOS)
  - We bind to 127.0.0.1 only — never expose this to the network
  - The library directory moves to a per-user location when running as a
    bundled app, so writes don't try to land inside the read-only .app

Packaging this into a .app bundle is a future step — the launcher itself is
ready to be a PyInstaller entry point, but the spec file + native dep
bundling (Pango, Cairo, libusb) hasn't been written yet.
